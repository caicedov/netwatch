# Product Vision

## Problem Statement

Deliver an immersive, strategic hacking simulation where players test creativity and skill in real time against other humans.

## Long-term Engagement

Continuous updates, evolving challenges, and community-driven content keep players returning and learning new tactics.

## Differentiators

Real-time multiplayer with server authority, a focus on hacking strategy over twitch reflexes, and a blend of competition plus collaboration.

## MVP Scope (Single Source)

### Features IN (must-have)
- Real-time multiplayer hacking interactions
- Basic hacking tools and strategies
- Player profiles and progression systems
- Server-authoritative gameplay for fairness

### Features OUT (defer)
- Advanced hacking tools
- Extensive character customization
- In-depth story mode

### Priority Order for IN items
1. Real-time interactions
2. Core hacking mechanics/tools
3. Player profiles and progression
4. Server authority hardening

### Rationale
Stay narrow to ship a solid core loop; defer breadth (customization, advanced tools, story) to avoid diluting delivery and testing.

## Success Metrics & Goals

- KPIs: 30-day retention, first-month active players, average session length, play frequency
- Goals: 40% 30-day retention; 1,000 active players in month one; 30-minute average sessions

## Risks & Mitigations

- Engagement risk (slow content updates) → plan regular content drops and community challenges
- Retention risk (competitive market) → validate core loop early and iterate with player feedback
- Market size risk (niche theme) → targeted marketing to strategy/simulation communities
- Scalability unknowns → test at 100-500 concurrent users, instrument latency, and scale horizontally as needed
